            <li>"Similar attacks can also be launched by a web attacker from a related domain"</li>             
            <li>"This paper aims to fill this gap with an in-depth empirical assessment of cookie injection attacks"</li>             
            <li>"The most standard definition of “origin” is a 3-tuple, consisting of the scheme, the domain and the port number. However, the notion of “origin” regarding cookies is fairly unusual – cookies are not separated between different schemes like HTTP and HTTPS, as well as port. The domain isolation of cookie is also weak: different but related domains can have a shared cookie scope."</li>             
            <li>"The lack of cookie integrity is a known problem, noted in the current specification [2]."</li>             
            <li>"Together, this work provides a close-up picture of the cookie integrity problem and the threats of cookie inject attacks."</li>
            <li>"Cookies are a browser-side assisted state management mechanism that are pervasively used by web applications [2]. Cookies can be set by either HTTP servers using “Set-Cookie:” header or client side JavaScript with a write to “document.cookie”"</li>             
            <li>"A cookie can have five optional attributes: domain and path specifying the cookie’s scope; expires stating when it should be discarded; secure specifying that it should only be sent over HTTPS connections, and HTTPOnly preventing browser-side scripts from reading the cookie. When sending a request to a server, a web browser includes all unexpired cookies whose domains and paths match the requested URL, excluding those marked as secure from the inclusion in an HTTP request."</li>
            <li>"Cookies have two fairly unusual behaviors. First, there is a critical disconnection between cookie storage and reading. Cookies are set and stored as a name/domain/path to value attributes mapping, but only name-value pairs are presented to both JavaScript and web servers. This asymmetry allows cookies with the same name but different domain and/or path scopes to be written into browser; a subsequent reader can read out all same name cookies together, yet cannot distinguish them because the other attributes such as path are not presented in the reading process."</li>             
            <li>"It is a known vulnerability that cookies can be injected by HTTP response into subsequent HTTPS request, and from one domain to another related domain. Johnston and Moore reported such problem in 2004 [19]. Their report already pinpointed the root cause: the loosely defined SOP for cookies"</li>             
            <li>"The active MITM attacker (including the classic MITM fully controlling the network and the Man-on-the- Side (i.e., wiretapping and packet-injecting)) can load arbitrary cookies through HTTP into the target’s cookie store."</li>
