                <li>"We define a CSV vulnerability as one which <strong>results from unsafe usage of untrusted data in the client-side code</strong> of the web application"</li>
                <li>"CSV vulnerabilities belong to the general class of input validation vulnerabilities"</li>
                <li>"For example, one type of CSV vulnerability involves data that enters the application through the browserâ€™s cross-window communication abstractions and is processed completely by JavaScript code, without ever being sent back to the web server"</li>
                <li>"Another type of CSV vulnerability is one where a web application sanitizes input data sufficiently before embedding it in its initial HTML response, but does not sanitize the data sufficiently for its use in the JavaScript component."</li>
                <li>"JavaScript has several dynamic features for code evaluation and is highly permissive in allowing code and data to be inter-mixed."</li>
                <li>"In JavaScript application code, we observe that parsing operations are syntactically indistinguishable from validation checks."</li>
                <li>"Third, in many web applications the client-side code <strong>periodically sends data to a remote server for processing via browser interfaces such as XMLHttpRequest</strong>, <u>and then operates on the returned result</u>. We call such a flow of data, to a server and back, a <strong>reflected flow</strong>"</li>
                <li>"In general, user data should not be interpreted as web application code. For instance, if user can inject scripts into the application, such a bug can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (such as a login-CSRF vulnerabilities)"</li>
                <li>"As an example, it distinguishes eval sinks(which allow injection of JavaScript code) from DOM sinks(which allow HTML injection). Our sink-aware fuzzing employs input mutation strategies that are based on grammars such as the HTML syntax, JavaScript syntax, or URL syntax grammars."</li>
                <li>"With JASIL, subsequent dynamic
taint analysis is greatly simplified because the tainting
engine only needs to reason about simple operations like
substring extraction and concatenation."</li>
