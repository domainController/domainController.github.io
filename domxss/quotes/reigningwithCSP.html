            <li>"We present content restrictions, and a content restrictions enforcement scheme called Content Security Policy (CSP), which intends to be one such layer. Content restrictions allow site designers or server administrators to specify how content interacts on their web sites—a security mechanism desperately needed by the untamed Web"
            </li>             
            <li>"Such a content restrictions feature would give web authors more control over data on their site—even as third party content is used. We argue that content restrictions should be used to control sites and propose an implementation of content restrictions called Content Security Policy (CSP), that does exactly this."
            </li>             
            <li>"Perhaps it is time to approach the problem from a different angle: instead of only filtering scripts from being inserted into a page, we can also disable invading scripts as they attempt to run"
            </li>
            <li>"We propose content restrictions be employed on websites— restrictions that give web application authors control over the content embedded on their site"
            </li>
            <li>"CSP will enable application developers to lay out content loading rules for their web site that will be enforced by the browser"
            </li>             
            <li>"Our solution is implemented in the HTTP protocol—outside the scope of any code running in a browser document—so that the security controls can be erected outside of the sandbox where web content is rendered."
            </li>             
            <li>"Our proposed scheme is intended to provide a site’s administrators control over behavior and appearance of their site S with a rule set that dictates what may load onto the site and into what contexts (image, script, etc)."
            </li>             
            <li>"Additionally, our scheme will help protect visitors of a web site S such that the information they provide the site will only be transmitted to S or other hosts authorized by S, preventing aforementioned data leak attacks"
            </li>                          
            <li>"XSS attacks are possible because the browser has no way to differentiate between content the server intended to send and content injected by an attacker"
