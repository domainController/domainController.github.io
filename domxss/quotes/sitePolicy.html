            <li>"Header-based security policies like CSP work <strong>at the granularity of individual HTTP responses</strong>, i.e., different pages within the security boundary of the same origin can deploy different security policies"
            </li>
            <li>"Cookies are small pieces of text communicated via an HTTP header or set via JavaScript, which map a key to a value and have optional attributes. <strong>Once set, they are stored by the browser and sent to the server in each request that matches the cookie’s scope</strong>."
            </li>
            <li>"HttpOnly ensures that cookies are not accessible from JavaScript (to disallow cookie theft through malicious JavaScript). Cookies can be flagged as Secure, meaning they must not be sent in unencrypted HTTP requests. The latest addition to the set of attributes is called SameSite, which is meant to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If this is set to lax, cookies are only sent on cross-site requests when the main frame is navigated in a safe way (e.g., through a GET request, not through POST). In case of strict, cookies are never sent across sites."
            </li>
            <li>"Hence, whenever the same cookie is set with different security attributes on different pages, there is an inconsistency in protection"
            </li>
            <li>"Note that, although the omission of a security attribute might be intentional, it is nevertheless dangerous. For example, an XSS in a page setting the HttpOnly attribute on a cookie can be used to steal the cookie from an XSS-free same-origin page that does not set the attribute (using frames or popups)."</li>             
            <li>"As CSP is a client-side defense mechanism, it needs to be communicated to the browser. This is either done through the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header, or in a meta tag with the corresponding http-equiv"</li>
            <li>"A notable issue of CSP is that, although it is enforced on a per-page basis, most browser assets (e.g., the Local Storage) are protected on a per-origin basis according to SOP: this means that even a single page with an unsafe CSP (or without CSP) might fully undermine a Web application’s security, since the attacker could get scripting capabilities in the application’s origin through that single page"</li>
            <li>"Hence, any injection vulnerability on the page would grant access to sameorigin content, e.g., cookies, Web storage, and the DOM; also, the attacker would be in the position to exfiltrate server-side secrets using XHR."</li>
