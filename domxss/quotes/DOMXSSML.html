                <li>"However, it is particularly challenging to statically analyze JavaScript, as it is a dynamic language and lacks strict typing information [14, 45]."</li>
                <li>"Code injection is possible because JavaScript <strong>can dynamically evaluate both HTML and script code using various DOM methods</strong> (such as document.write) <u>as well as JavaScript native constructs</u> (such as eval). This class of attacks is commonly referred to as DOM-based XSS [27,29]."</li>
                <li>"In the example, the display child window <u>uses eval to serialize the input string from a JSON format</u>, <strong>without validating for its expected structure</strong>."</li>
