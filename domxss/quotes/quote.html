            <ol>
                <li>"DOM-based XSS is caused by <strong>unsafe data flows from attacker-controlled sources</strong>, such as the document.location property, into <strong>security sensitive APIs</strong>, e.g., document.write."</li>
                <li>"Furthermore, compared to server-side languages such as Java or C#, a large portion of JavaScript code frequently relies <strong>on runtime interpretation of string data as executable code via APIs</strong> such as eval()"</li>
                <li>"Finally, it is common practice for modern Web applications to include <strong>third-party JavaScript code using script-tags that point to cross-domain hosts</strong>"</li>
                <li>"We present the design and implementation of a <strong>dynamic, byte-level taint-tracking approach</strong> in JavaScript engines. Through directly altering the <strong>JavaScript engine’s implementation of the low-level string type</strong>"</li>
                <li>"Due to our exact <strong>knowledge of data source and syntactical context of the final data sink</strong>, our system can create attack payloads that match <strong>the syntactic surroundings of the injection point</strong>"</li>
                <li>" Depending on the Web application’s program logic, it processes attacker-controllable inputs <strong>and at some point in time conducts a string-to-code conversion</strong>"</li>
                <li>"<strong>If input is not sanitized correctly</strong>, the attacker may be able to inject his own code into the application."</li>
                <li>"Web applications <strong>commonly insert generated HTML code into the DOM via functions such as document.write, innerHTML</strong> or insertAdjacentHTML. When these functions are called, <strong>the browser parses the string parameter and interprets the contents as HTML code, which is then inserted into a certain position within the DOM</strong>. If user input flows into these sinks, sanitization or encoding functions have to be used in order to avoid code injection vulnerabilities. <strong>If the input is not sanitized correctly an attacker is able to inject own HTML tags including \<script\>, which enables JavaScript execution.</strong>" </li>
                <li> "<strong>eval takes a string parameter, interprets it as JavaScript code and executes it</strong>. Besides <strong><a href="sinksources.html#sinks" target="_blank">eval</a> and its aliases setTimeout and setInterval</strong>, there are also other contexts in which strings are converted into JavaScript code such as script.innerText, script.text, script.textContent and the assignment of strings to event handler attributes." </li>
                <li>"For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_HdKzsfxmg&t=257s">vulnerability</a> detection, we utilize a modified browsing engine that supports <strong>dynamic, byte-level tainttracking of suspicious flows</strong>. Through directly <strong>altering the engine’s string type implementation</strong>, we achieve complete coverage of all JavaScript language features and the full DOM API."</li>
                <li>"Due to the exact knowledge of <strong>data source and syntactical context of the final data sink</strong>, our system is able to create <strong>attack payloads that match the syntactic surroundings of the injection point</strong>"</li>
                <li>"For this, we modified the open-source browser Chromium in such a manner that its JavaScript engine V8 as well as <strong>the DOM implementation in WebKit</strong> were enhanced with taint-tracking capabilities. For both components of the browser, we selected to use a <strong>byte-wise taint-tracking approach built directly into the respective string representations</strong>. "</li>
                <li>"Alhough the code is written in C++, <strong>V8 for the most parts does not make use of a class-concept using member variables</strong> when representing JavaScript objects like strings or arrays"</li>
                <li>"To also be able to determine <strong>whether a given character was encoded using the built-in functions encodeURI, encodeURI-Component and escape</strong>, we used the lower three of the four remaining bits <strong>to store whether one or more of these functions were applied to the string</strong>"</li>
                <li>"<strong>Every object in V8 stores a pointer to its map</strong>. The map describes the class of an object. In V8, there are maps for each type of object. We found an used part of a bitmap in the maps and used it to create new map objects for tainted strings"</li>
                <li>"After patching the string implementation itself, <strong>we also instrumented the string propagation function such as substring, concat, charAt, etc</strong>. This is necessary to ensure that <strong>the byte-wise taint-tracking information</strong> is also propagated during string conversions."</li>
                <li>"In contrast to the V8 engine, <strong>WebKit makes frequent use of the concept of member variables for its classes</strong>. Therefore, to allow for the detection of a tainted string, we were able to add such a member denoting whether a string is tainted or not."</li>
                <li>"This is necessary because <strong>tainted data might be temporarily stored in the DOM before flowing to a sink</strong>, e.g. by setting the href attribute of an anchor and later using this in a document.write. To allow for correct propagation of the taint information, we not only needed to change the string implementation but also modify <strong>the HTML tokenizer</strong>.When HTML content is set via JavaScript (e.g. using innerHTML), <strong>it is not just stored as a string but rather parsed and split up into its tree structure</strong>. Since we want to ensure that taint information is carried into the tag names and attributes in the generated tree, these changes were also necessary"</li>
                <li>"There are various reasons why a successful exploitation is not possible for an existing flow. For example, the Web site could use built-in or <strong>custom encoding or filter functions that are capable of defusing a malicious payload.</strong>"</li>
                <li>"Therefore, a verification step is needed <strong>to tell vulnerable data flows apart from non-exploitable flows</strong>. In order to do so our system uses the data received from the taint-tracking engine to reliable generate valid Cross-Site Scripting Exploits."</li>
                <li>"Therefore, the exploit first has to <strong>break out of the current context to be able to execute the malicious script code</strong>. The first part of each exploit serves as a <strong>”break out sequence”</strong> to escape to a context where JavaScript execution is possible."</li>
                <li>Afterwards, the exploit has to take care of <strong>trailing string fragments</strong> in such a way that these fragments <strong>do not interfere with the execution of the payload</strong>.</li>
                <li>"While the escapeSequence is very trivial to choose, <strong>the breakOutSequence needs careful crafting</strong> to result in a successful exploit."</li>
                <li>"JavaScript context-specific generation is necessary whenever a data flow ends within a sink that interprets a string as JavaScript code. This is the case for functions such as eval & Function, <strong>Event handlers (such as onload and onerror) and DOM properties such as script.textContent, script.text and script.innerText.</strong>"</li>
                <li>"While browsers are very forgiving when parsing and executing syntactically incorrect HTML, they are quite strict when it comes to JavaScript code execution. If the JavaScript parser encounters a syntax error, it cancels the script execution for the complete block/function"</li>
                <li>"An HTML context is present whenever a tainted string is directly converted into HTML code."</li>
                <li>"In order to create a valid exploit, the system needs to <strong>determine into which DOM node the tainted parts will be transformed when the string-to-HTML conversion takes place</strong>"</li>
                <li>"Every character sequence that is placed outside a tag or a comment or that is <strong>located in between an opening and a closing tag is regarded as a TextNode by the HTML parser.</strong>"</li>
                <li>"When using innerHTML, outerHTML or <strong>adjacentHTML</strong> browsers react differently than document.write in terms of script execution."</li>
                <li>"However, <strong>it is still possible to execute scripts via an injection through innerHTML. In order to do so, the framework makes use of event handlers</strong>"</li>
                <li>"When innerHTML inserts the img tag, <strong>the browser creates an HTTP request to the non-existing resource</strong>. Obviously, <strong>this request will fail and trigger the onerror event handler</strong> that executes the given payload."</li>
                <li>"We designed our experiment set-up to meet these requirements, utilizing the following components: <strong>Our flow-tracking rendering engine</strong> to identify and record potentially unsafe JavaScripts (as discussed in Sec. 4), <strong>our exploit generation</strong> and <strong>validation framework</strong> (as presented in Sec. 5), and a crawling infrastructure that automatically causes the browsing engine to visit and examine a large set of URLs."</li>
                <li id="BrokenURLparsing">"As browsers sometimes auto-encode certain parts of user controlled values, it is not possible to inject code into some of the analyzed sources. One example for this is <strong>location.search that is auto-encoded by all browser</strong> except Internet Explorer. Another source that is encoded by every modern browser is <a href="sinksources.html#pathname">location.pathname</a>. <strong>An injection via location.pathname is in general not possible</strong> until the application itself decodes the value"</li>
                <li id="windownameflows">"Within our dataset, we detected a surprisingly high number (>2 million) of flows originating from <strong><a href="sinksources.html#windowname">window.name</a></strong> that we couldn’t explain at first sight. Although some of them were exploitable, we soon discovered the reason for this number. <strong>Most of these flows are not exploitable via DOM XSS</strong> as they are caused by a simple programming error."</li>
                <li>"For one, none of the exploits abusing JavaScript sinks, such as eval(), were detected by XSS Auditor. This <strong>stems</strong> from the fact that <strong>the auditor is implemented inside the HTML parser</strong> and thus cannot detected direct JavaScript sinks."</li>
                <li>"If we take our figures from Section 6.2 into account, we see that <strong>a tainted string consists</strong>– on average – <strong>of about three tainted substrings</strong>". Thus, an attacker has on average <strong>three possible injection points</strong> in order to leverage the techniques presented by Nikiforakis</li>
                <li>In order <strong>to decrease false positive rates</strong> several approaches have been studied <strong>to automatically generate a valid exploit payloads</strong> for validation purposes</li>
                <li>In order to do so, the authors use <strong>symbolic taint-tracking</strong> and <strong>input mutations</strong> to generate example exploits</li>

            <ol>
                <li>"Presumably due to increased filtering of this tag, in the more recent submissions to OPENBUGBOUNTY, we observe a trend of <strong>replacing the \<script\> tag with \<img\> or \<svg\> tags and indirect code execution using the onload and onerror event handlers</strong>"</li>
                <li>"Unfortunately, developers often omit input sanitisation entirely, use an incorrect type of escaping, or implement custom sanitisation code that is not sufficient to block the attacks."</li>
                <li>"In DOM-based client XSS, several works [14, 15, 20] reported characteristics of exploitable data flows, such as the source and sink types, and cognitive complexity. <strong>In our context of reflected server XSS, data flows and transformations occur in (hidden) server-side code, thus we need different methods</strong>"</li>

                <li>"While a classic XSS attack usually abuses a lack of proper filltering on the server, <strong>DOMXSS only affects client-side vulnerabilities</strong> and most times it is being carried out by the use of properties only the client has access to"</li>
                <li id="helloWorldOfDOMXSS">"One example for those properties is the <strong><a href="sinksources.html#locationhash">location.hash</a></strong> string.

            <li>"In addition to the Same-Origin Policy for JavaScript interaction and DOM access between documents, other types of Same-Origin Policies exist for XmlHttpRequests (van Kesteren et al., 2014) or Flash (Zalewski, 2009b). <strong>For XmlHttpRequests, the policy can be relaxed using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong> (van Kesteren, 2014) <strong>to allow cross-domain communication</strong>"</li>
