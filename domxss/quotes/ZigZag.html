                <li>"In particular, advances in browser JavaScript engines and the adoption of HTML5 APIs has led to an explosion of highly complex web applications where the majority of application code has been pushed to the client."
                </li>
                <li>"This is due to a combination of factors, including the difficulty of training developers"</li>

                <li>"While this provides much greater flexibility to application developers, it also opens the door for vulnerabilities to be introduced into web applications due to <strong>insufficient origin checks</strong> or other programming mistakes."
                </li>
                <li>"postMessage is but one potential vector for the more general problem of <strong>insufficient client-side validation</strong> (CSV) vulnerabilities."
                </li>
                <li>"These vulnerabilities can be exploited by <strong>input from untrusted sources</strong>"
                </li>
                <li>"Also, <u>in contrast to other popular web attack classes such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</u>, <strong>CSVs represent application logic flaws</strong> that are <u>closely tied to the intended behavior</u> of the application and, consequently, can be difficult to identify and defend against in a generic, automated fashion."
                </li>
                <li>"We present a novel in-browser anomaly detection system based on <a href="http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/">dynamic invariant detection</a> that defends clients against previously unknown clientside validation attacks."
                </li>
                <li>"To tamper with the ad network, an attacker must be able to invoke postMessage in the same context. This can be achieved by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities from user content, framing the webmail service, or exploiting a logic vulnerability.Hence, the attacker has to send an email to a victim user that contains XSS code, or lure the victim to a site that will frame the webmail service"
                </li>
                <!-- ici le threat model semble intimement lie a du thrid party --->
                <li>"Programs become vulnerable to such attacks through <strong>unsafe handling of DOM properties that are not controlled by the server</strong>; examples include URL fragments or the referrer"
                </li>
