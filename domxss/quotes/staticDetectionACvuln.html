        ========= Static Detection of AC Vulnerabilities ========= </a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Compared with those in traditional software, access checks in web applications are harder to get right because of the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol. In traditional software, once a user has passed an authentication check, the system remembers the identity of the user until she logs out or a timeout event happens. This is not the case for web applications, which must parse each new HTTP request to identify a previously logged-in user</li>
            
            <li>an injection vulnerability exists when an untrusted input flows into a sensitive sink without proper sanitization. To detect injection vulnerabilities, it is sufficient to analyze individual pages separately to examine where untrusted user inputs can flow. In contrast, access control vulnerabilities are application-specific, and it is necessary to examine connections between pages.</li>
            
            <li>Web application developers frequently make implicit assumptions of allowed accesses and protect privileged pages by hiding links to these pages from unauthorized users. However, security by obscurity is insufficient to prevent a determined and skilled attacker from accessing these pages, viewing sensitive data or performing dangerous operations</li>
            
            <li>In this paper, we use role to represent a unique set of privileges that a group of users has. Most web applications have at least three types of roles: the role for administrators, the role for normal logged-in users and the role for public or anonymous users.</li>
            
            <li>Access control checks must be performed before granting access to any privileged resource to prevent privilege escalation attacks. When implicit assumptions are not matched by explicit access checks, unauthorized accesses are possible</li>
            
            <li>We propose the first role-based static analysis to detect access control vulnerabilities with <strong>automatic inference on implicit access control assumptions</strong></li>
            
            <li>Our key observations are that each role represents a unique set of privileges, and intended accesses for each role are reflected in explicit links shown in the presentation layer of an application</li>
