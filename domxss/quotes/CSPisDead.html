        ========== CSP Is Dead, Long Live CSP! ========== </a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>"By disallowing <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/examples/allow-inline-script/" target="_blank">inline scripts</a> and allowing only <strong>trusted domains</strong> as a source of external scripts, <a href="https://domaincontroller.github.io/domxss/csp.html">CSP</a> aims to <strong>restrict</strong> a site's capability to execute malicious client-side code."
            </li>
            <li>"We suggest that the <strong>model</strong> of designating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEzBnzhluHY&t=779s" target="_blank">trust</a> by specifying <strong>URL whitelists</strong> from which scripts can execute should be replaced with an approach based on <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/">nonce</a> and <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/hash/">hashes</a>, already defined by the <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">CSP</a> specification and available in major browser implementations."
            </li>
            <li>"In a <strong>nonce-based policy</strong>, instead of whitelisting hosts and domains for script execution, the application defines a single-use, <strong>unguessable token</strong> <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/">(nonce)</a> <u>delivered both in the CSP policy and as an HTML attribute</u> of legitimate, application-controlled scripts. The user agent allows the execution only of those scripts whose nonce <strong>matches the value</strong> specified in the policy"
            </li>
            <li>"A CSP policy is delivered in the Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header or in a <meta> element."
            </li>
            <li>"CSP source lists (commonly known as whitelists) have been a core part of CSP and are the traditional way to specify trust relationships"
            </li>
            <li>With â€™<a href="https://content-security-policy.com/strict-dynamic/">strict-dynamic</a>â€™, dynamically generated scripts implicitly <strong>inherit the nonce</strong> from the trusted script that created them.
            </li>
            <li>"unsafe-inline allows the execution of inline \<script\> blocks and JavaScript event handlers (effectively re- moving any <a href="https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/index.html">CSP</a>  protection against XSS)."
            </li> 
            <li>"unsafe-eval allows the use of JavaScript APIs that execute string data as code, such as eval(), setTimeout(), setInterval(), and the Function constructor."
            </li>
            <li>"A CSP nonce allows the policy to specify a one-time value that acts as an authorization token for scripts (script-src 'nonce-random-value'). Any script on the page with the correct nonce="random-value" at- tribute will be allowed to execute."
            </li>
            <li>"In practice, however, clickjacking protection with X-Frame- Options is rarely subverted,"
            </li>
            <li>"The security benet of <a href="https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/index.html">CSP</a>  is overwhelmingly concen- trated in two directives that prevent script execution: script- src and object-src"
            </li>
            <li>"An attacker who can inject and execute scripts is able to bypass the restrictions of all other directives. As a result, applications that use a policy without safe script-src and object-src source lists gain very limited benefit from CSP"
            </li>
            <!-- Fin de lecture jusqu'a la 4eme page Samedi 13 Mars 16:57 , relire les deux derniers paragraphe peut-etre-->
            <li>"To address issues about insucient granularity of domain-
based source lists, CSP2 introduced the ability to constrain
whitelists to specic paths on a given domain (e.g. exam-
ple.org/foo/bar)"
            </li>
            <li>"the primary reason for the insecurity of poli- cies is the bypassability of script-src whitelists. On the modern web, an approach based on whitelisting domains (even if accompanied with paths) appears to be too in exi- ble to oer developers security gains and prevent XSS"
            </li>
            <li>"Instead of relying on whitelists, application maintain-
ers should apply a nonce-based protection approach."
            </li>
