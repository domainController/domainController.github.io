        <ol>
            <li>"Given the move to a more interconnected Web, standard bodies and browser vendors have added new mechanisms to enable cross-origin communication, primarily <strong>domain relaxation, postMessages, and CORS</strong>"</li>
            <li>"While prior work has already shown the pitfalls of not using these mechanisms securely (e.g., <strong>omitting origin checks for incoming postMessages</strong>)"</li>
            <li>"The SOP proved to be too restrictive for the modern Web, and the W3C standardized two new ways of cross-origin communication, namely postMessages and CORS"</li>
            <li>"The main difference to prior work is that an attacker does not need to compromise a third-party server to manipulate the JavaScript it hosts, <strong>but it is rather sufficient to find an XSS vulnerability on a trusted communication partner</strong>"</li>
            <li>"While browsers already implemented a relaxation of the SOP based on a common parent domain (dubbed <strong>Domain Relaxation</strong>), the W3C also standardized new mechanisms to address this demand, namely postMessages and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)."</li>
            <li>"To record the use of postMessages, <strong>we use Puppeteer to inject JavaScript code to hook the EventListener of message events</strong>. Given the lack of automated tools to analyze postMessage handlers, we rely on manual analysis of the involved JavaScript code."</li>
