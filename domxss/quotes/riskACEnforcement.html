        <ol>
            <li>Access control restricts the subjects (e.g., users and programs) that may perform operations (e.g., read and write) over objects (e.g., les and records). It has long been recommended that the software that implements access control should separate the access control mechanism from the access control policy. Access control mechanisms should satisfy the requirements specied by the reference monitor concept [6], such as complete mediation, to enforce access control policies correctly. Access control policies should express the access control requirements to be enforced.</li>
            
            <li>In addition, least privilege policies [43], which favor functionality over blocking risky operations, are more popular today.</li>
            
            <li>Second, errors in implementing access control mechanisms may produce risks. For example, programmers may misplace the access control policy checks, which are often called <strong>authorization hooks</strong>, in their programs.</li>
            
            <li>In this paper, we explore the problem of tracking the accumulation of risk in access control enforcement</li>
            
            <li>Based on these insights, we identify four dierent types of risks taken in access control: (1) risk due to authorizing unsafe operations; (2) risk due to abuse of authorized permissions; (3) risk due to lack of program context; and (4) risk due to the granularity of authorization hooks.</li>
            
            <li>e fundamental problem is that choices in both access control enforcement mechanisms and access control policies introduce risk, and that at present we neither track nor react to such risk. As a result, adversaries may be allowed to perform operations that exploit such risks with impunity.</li>
