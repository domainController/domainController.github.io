            ========= Empirical Study of CORS ========= </a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>"Cross-origin resource access can be classified into two categories: cross-origin local resources access (e.g., for DOM, cookie) and cross-origin network resources access (e.g., for XMLHttpRequest).
            "</li>
            <li>"<strong>JavaScript changes the threat model of the Web</strong>, and introduces significant risks to the cross-origin access.
            "</li>
            <li>"In order to ensure that different web applications cannot interfere with each other, Netscape introduced the Same Origin Policy (SOP), the fundamental isolation strategy for client-side web application security.
            "</li>             
            <li>"Although SOP prevents JavaScript from reading the response of a cross-origin request (except a few cases such as imported script), <strong>it does not prevent client-side JavaScript from sending cross-origin POST requests</strong> (e.g., using automatic form submission without user <u>awareness</u>).
            "</li>
            <li>"There are currently no effective protocol-level solution for these two types of attacks. Proposed solutions for CSRF attacks, such as <strong>Origin header</strong> and <strong><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07">same-site cookies</a></strong>, are not widely deployed due to incomplete browser support.
            "</li>

            <li>"None of the browsers protect port 6379 (redis) or 11211 (memcache), for example, leaving those services vulnerable to HFPA attacks [17].
            "</li>
            <li>"In August 2011, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> was included in Fetch standard by Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), another web standard organization founded by browser vendors including Mozilla, Opera and Apple.Since then, CORS was independently updated in the Fetch standard, and has minor differences from the W3C standard. Browser vendors such as Mozilla gave priority to the WHATWG’s standard, resulting in the obsolescence of W3C CORS standard in August 2017.
            "</li>
            <li>"Essentially, the CORS protocol is an <strong>access control model</strong> regulating access to cross-origin network resources (including sending requests and reading responses) between browsers and servers. In this model, a requesting website script <strong>initiates a resource access request from a user’s browser, which automatically adds an</strong> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin">Origin header</a> to indicate the requester’s identity; then the third-party website returns the access control policy;

            <li>"In the second case, a web attacker can carry out similar attacks on a strongly secured website by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities on a weak website
            "</li>
            <li>"The core function of CORS is that the policies generated by resource servers instruct client browsers to relax SOP restrictions and share cross-origin resources.
