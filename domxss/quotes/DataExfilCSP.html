            <li>While XSS can be used to compromise both <strong>confidentiality</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> of web applications, the focus of this paper is on confidentiality.
            </li>

            <li>XSS to break confidentiality consists of two basic ingredients: <strong>injection</strong> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/">exfiltration</a>
            </li>

            <li>Common mitigation techniques against injection are data <strong>sanitization</strong> and <strong>encoding</strong> performed by the server, as to prevent JavaScript from being injected in HTML.
            </li>

            <li>The CSP specification makes a single mention of data exfiltration. In the non-normative usage description of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#directive-connect-src">connect-src</a> directive, the specification acknowledges that JavaScript offers mechanisms that enable data exfiltration, but does not discuss how CSP addresses this issue

            <li>An important area of performance enhancements focuses on reducing the load time of a web page through prefetch- ing and caching. Browsers anticipate a user's next actions and preemptively load certain resources into the browser cache.Web developers can annotate their web page with
            </li>

            <li>Domain Name Service (DNS) prefetching is extensively used to pre- resolve a hostname into an IP address and cache the result, saving hundreds of milliseconds of the user's time [22</li>             

            <li>In addition to DNS prefetching, browser vendors are im- proving their browsers' performance by prefetching resources and storing them in the browser's cache
            </li>             

            <li>In reality, many <link> relationships used for resource prefetching are not affected by the CSP, limiting the effect of CSP's restric- tions on communication with external entities
