        <ol> 
            <li>Sometimes the initial HTTP request does not directly lead to users' intended destination, and the browser must send multiple HTTP requests sequentially. This process, known as URL redirection or HTTP redirection, indicates that a subsequent request depends on the response provided by its immediate predecessor
            </li>

            <li>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) [21] is a security policy to prevent SSL-Stripping and is supported by major browsers, When a client sends an HTTP request to an HSTS-enabled domain, the browser will internally upgrade the request to HTTPS before sending it.
            </li>

            <li>Since redirections are processed by the client browser in the background and only the last URL and its security status will be displayed in the browser's address bar, it is likely that users are unaware of potential vulnerabilities
            </li>

            <li>The rst study uses the Alexa top 1M websites for a lightweight, comprehensive analysis to get a general sense of the redirection trails when visiting a website's home page</li>
