            <li>"The specifications can cover most of the XSS sinks found in practice. However, browser vendors may not fully follow specifications and can implement non-standard features that are prone to XSS. An example of such features is content sniffing, with which browsers may ignore the metadata of a data blob and interpret the type of the blob by heuristically analyzing its content. Skilled attackers can exploit this feature to manipulate browsers and carry out code executions not expected by web developers and users [33]."</li>
