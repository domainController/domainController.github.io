                <li>"Preventing XSS typically requires website owners to not only sanitize all untrusted inputs to their web application, but also to sanitize all input that could be received <strong>by the client’s JavaScript <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bVcTFOKRyo&t=351s" target="_blank">interpreter—</a></strong>"</li>
                <li>". The existence of such flows only indicates that data from a source can reach a sink, but does not account for <strong>whether the data has been <u>sanitized</u> by the programmer</strong>. Thus, once a flow with a potential DOM XSS vulnerability is observed, <strong>the flow must be confirmed to be exploitable</strong>"In this paper, we show how to more accurately detect whether <strong>a flow that is potentially vulnerable is capable of being exploited.</strong></li>
                <li>"..., we focus, similarly to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxJAeWOop1Y">prior work</a> [22], on confirming flows from <a href="../sinksources.html" target="_blank">URL-based sources</a>. These are of particular interest because, compared to other flows, they are easy for attackers to exploit"</li>
                <li>"We crawled <strong>the homepages and five random subpages</strong> of websites"</li>
                <li>"In addition, we qualitatively examined the code paths that led to the vulnerabilities. We observed, for example, that <strong>most of the vulnerabilities did not share code</strong>, implying that the vulnerabilities we found are <strong>due to custom code</strong>, rather than the inclusion of buggy shared libraries"</li>
                <li>"However, some static tools were shown to have low false negative rates and at the same time identify DOM XSS issues not found by the dynamic analysis, suggesting that <strong>dynamic analyses and static analyses are finding <u>qualitatively</u> different types of vulnerabilities.</strong>"</li>
                <li>"We develop a <strong>modified version of Chromium for tracking the taint information of strings</strong>, which we are releasing as open source.1"</li>
                <li>"An attacker <strong>may convince</strong> their victims to click on the link using social engineering, or <strong>may embed</strong> the link in an iframe on a website that the attacker controls."</li>
                <li>"Chromium, for example, <strong>does not encode any characters after the ‘#’ symbol</strong>"</li>
                <li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ergeHSRr1a0&t=391s" target="_blank">Sinks</a> can include <strong>any mechanism to execute arbitrary code</strong>, for example: the eval function, document.write, JavaScript event handlers (e.g., the “onclick” attribute), and URLs that have a JavaScript scheme (e.g., <a href='javascript:...'></a>)."</li>
                <li>"<u>Server-side taint-tracking</u> and <u>static-analysis</u> techniques <strong>fundamentally cannot be applied for detecting client-side vulnerabilities</strong> [14], [37]"</li>
                <li>" However,web-application firewalls are known to allow many attacks <strong>due to their reliance on simple pattern matching</strong> [13], [18]."</li>
                <li><strong>The state of the art for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities is using <u>dynamic taint tracking</u></strong>. This technique marks potentially attacker-controlled sources as “tainted” and propagates information about tainted values throughout the program</li>
                <li>"Other work, building upon a system for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities using <strong>browser-agnostic taint tracking</strong> [29], provided a method to track taint information and inject an extension that sanitizes injected strings at run time just before those strings are inserted into the sensitive sink functions [28]."</li>
                <li>Additionally, prior work quantitatively examined DOM XSS vulnerabilities [35], finding that while <strong>many vulnerabilities are of low complexity, some are the result of highly complex JavaScript interactions</strong>. The researchers found that many DOM XSS bugs are the result of <strong>vulnerable third-party scripts, missing knowledge about browser-provided APIs, unaware developers, or incompatible first- and third-party code</strong>.</li>
                <li>"However, <strong>the degree to which static-analysis tools can detect and prevent real DOM XSS vulnerabilities is unknown</strong>. In addition, JavaScript as a programming language <strong>has traditionally been difficult to statically analyze because of its dynamic features</strong> (for example,widespread use of the eval function and reliance on dynamic typing)."</li>
                <li>"The browser collected information about what data flows occurred in the page, and output a log file <strong>detailing the flows and the encoding methods applied. For example, using the encodeURIComponent JavaScript function will modify the taint information to reflect that the string has been encoded using the encodeURIComponent function. <strong>During taint propagation, matching encoding-decoding pairs will cancel each other</strong>."</strong></li>
                <li>"In this example, <u>the encodeURI function encodes the location so that the double-quote character cannot be injected</u>."</li>
                <li>"This allows taint information to be precisely propagated during string concatenation or slicing."</li>
                <li>"Whether a flow is vulnerable depends on the context of the injection in the HTML or JavaScript, the encoding functions that have been applied, and the source and sink types. For example, if we detect that a tainted value is not encoded and begins in the context of an HTML double-quoted attribute, then that flow is potentially vulnerable"</li>
                <li id="sinksensitivefunction">"Each flow has a source, through which an attacker could inject code, and <strong>a sink, a sensitive function that consumes data derived from the source of the flow</strong>"</li>
                <li>" For example, to exploit a cookie flow, <strong>an attacker must find a way to manipulate the victim’s cookies</strong>; for message flows, an attacker must find a potential flow whose code <strong>does not check the message origin and also send the message at the proper time</strong>, when the receiver is expecting it"</li>
                <li>"We first discard flows in which <strong>the tainted value is encoded using a built-in encoding method</strong>, for example, the <strong>encodeURIComponent</strong> function; <strong>we are certain that such flows would ordinarily not be exploitable</strong>"</li>
                <li id="confirmedvulnerableflows">"We next remove from consideration flows that could not be exploited in Chromium due to <strong>Chromium</strong>’s natural
                    <strong>encoding of some URL variables</strong> (for example, <strong>Chromium automatically encodes the content of <a href="../sinksources.html#locationsearch">document.location.search</a> to prevent the occurrence of any character that would not be allowed in a URL</strong>). "</li>
                <li id="adsAnalyticsVector">"We found that the vast majority, 2,645 of 3,219 of our unique vulnerabilities (82%), were found to execute inside iframes with domains that were known to serve web advertisements or perform <a href="../../entrepreneurship/projects.html#blogIdeasFeatures">analytics</a>"</li>
                <li>"We speculate that this difference is because <strong>JavaScript programs are becoming more complex</strong>, and as a consequence <strong>DOM XSS vulnerabilities are becoming more frequent</strong>."</li>
                <li>"We interpret this to mean that most DOM XSS vulnerabilities are due to custom code, and not library code that is shared by many domains."</li>
                <li>One example of a potentially vulnerable flow that is not actually vulnerable to DOM XSS attacks is when the application performs custom sanitization of inputs that is not detected by the taint-tracking engine</li>
                <li>"we limit our candidate exploits to the part of the URL string after the hash (the ‘#’ character), as this segment of the URL string <strong>is not sent to the website hosting the page, but only processed internally by the JavaScript running in the browser</strong>."</li>

                <li>"In our test, we visited a large number of web pages but did not attempt to exercise much of the web application’s functionality, for example, by </strong>clicking on fields</strong>, entering data into forms, or sending messages to pages. <strong>It is likely that such activities would reveal more vulnerabilities</strong>."</li>
                <li>"<a href="https://github.com/pauljt/scanjs">ScanJS</a> generally appears to identify poor coding practices that lead to DOM XSS vulnerabilities, rather than detecting such vulnerabilities"</li>
