                ========= Precise client-side protection against DOM-based XSS ========= </a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>"To demonstrate this, we conduct a thorough analysis of the current state-of-the-art in <strong>browser-based XSS filtering</strong> and uncover a set of conceptual shortcomings, that allow efficient creation of filter evasions, especially in the case of DOM-based XSS."</li>
            <li>"The malicious code is executed in the client-side context of the victim, affecting his clientside execution environment. <strong>Hence, a well-suited place to protect end users against XSS vulnerabilities is the Web browser</strong>."</li>
            <li>"These contemporary client-side XSS filtering mechanisms rely on <strong>string-based comparison</strong> of outgoing HTTP requests and incoming HTTP responses to detect reflected XSS attack payloads"</li>
            <li>"Instead of applying regular expressions on the string representations of the HTTP requests or responses, the Auditor is placed <strong>between the HTML parser and the JavaScript engine</strong> [2]. The idea behind this placement is, that an attackerâ€™s <strong>payload has to be parsed by the HTML parser to be transferred to the JavaScript engine</strong> where the injected payload is being executed."</li>
            <li>"the Auditor receives each <strong>token</strong> generated by the HTML parser"</li>
            <li>"Dangerous Attributes are, in the view of the Auditor, attributes that either contain <strong>a JavaScript URL</strong> or have the name of an <strong>inline event handler (onclick, onload</strong>, etc.) as these attributes can enable XSS attacks"</li>
            <li>"In general, the Auditor is called whenever potentially dangerous elements are encountered <strong>during the initial parsing of the HTTP response</strong>"</li>
