             <li>"While the Same-Origin Policy prevents direct data exchange with documents from other origins, the postMessage API offers one <strong>relaxation</strong> that allows developers <strong>to exchange data across these boundaries</strong>."</li>
             <li>"To achieve this goal, we present an automated analysis framework running inside the browser, which uses <strong>selective forced execution</strong> paired with lightweight dynamic taint tracking to find traces in the analyzed handlers that end in sinks allowing for code execution or state alterations."</li>
             <li>"The web that we know today heavily relies on <strong>the intricate interplay of various services that jointly contribute to the plethora of feature-rich applications</strong> that we have grown fond of over the years. This interconnectivity, however, would not be possible without controlled relaxations of the webâ€™s fundamental security principle, i.e., the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)."</li>
             <li>"The receiving frame can register JavaScript callback functions that are invoked when a postMessage is dispatched to the current frame."</li>
             <li>"By using an <strong>SMT solver</strong> on the path constraints extracted from these traces, we can generate postMessages that trigger the dangerous behavior"</li>
             <li>"However, such two frames <strong>might need to exchange data to allow users a seamless integration of services</strong>, e.g., a website using a third-party payment provider that handles the billing of the customer"</li>
             <li>"In the setting of postMessages, one frame sends a postMessage containing arbitrary, <strong>serializable data</strong> to another frame by calling the postMessage functionality <strong>on a handle to the other frame</strong>."</li>
