        <ol>
            <li>According to a recent report by OWASP, broken access control is involved in three out of the top ten vulnerabilities: A7 - <a href="https://wiki.pentaho.com/display/PEOpen/A7+Missing+Function+Level+Access+Control">Missing Function Level Access Control</a>, A4 - <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">A4 - Insecure Direct Object References</a>, and A2 - <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-broken-authentication/">Broken Authentication and Session Management</a>. Due to a lack of proper access enforcement, many web applications check access rights before making functionality or system resources visible (via web links, for example). However, the same check must be carried out on the server side when a functionality or a resource is accessed. Otherwise, attackers can forge requests to get access to the resource without being authorised (A7). The second vulnerability (A4) refers to the exposure of direct references to internal resources (such as files). If such internal resources are not adequately protected, they can be maliciously accessed. The third vulnerability (A2) relates to the authentication and session management of an access control mechanism. If they are implemented improperly, attackers can compromise user credentials or impersonate other users to access their private resources.</li>
            
            <li>Broken access control is a likely risk if the access control model of a system is not <strong>designed and documented properly</strong> or the access control <strong>implementation is not adequately tested</strong>.</li>
            
            <li>In general, access control (AC) consists of two artefacts: <strong>AC policy specifications</strong> and <strong>AC mechanisms</strong> that implement and enforce AC policies. AC policies can be specified explicitly using models, such as <strong>RBAC</strong> (Role-Based Access Control), or rules, such as XACML</li>
            
            <li>An access space of a specific user consists of discovered resources and the permissions the user has to these resources.</li>
            
            <li id="acconcepts">Access Control is a pervasive security mechanism which is used in virtually all systems. It is concerned with authorising the right resource access permissions to users. The <strong>fundamental concepts</strong> in an access control model include <strong>users, subjects, objects</strong>, and <strong>permissions</strong>. User refers to human users who interact with a computer system. Subject refers to a process or program acting on behalf of a user. <u>Object refers to resources</u> accessible from a system, Object and resource are used interchangeably. Permission refers to the authorisation to perform some actions (e.g., read, update) on objects.</li>
            
            <li>Over the past decade, a number of access control models have been proposed. Among them, the <strong>Role-based</strong> Access Control (<strong>RBAC</strong>) model is the <strong>most widely</strong> adopted. Role is the most important concept in RBAC and refers to different privileges on a system. Users and permissions are assigned to roles; these assignments govern users' accesses to resources</li>
            
            <li>Our work belongs to the research family of applying dynamic analysis to infer program specifications for detecting security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            
            <li>In the area of access control analysis, a technique called "differential analysis" has been proposed to detect authorisation vulnerabilities in web applications. It involves crawling a system under test using different authenticated users' sessions and unauthenticated ones in order to determine which portions of the system are accessible from which users.</li>
