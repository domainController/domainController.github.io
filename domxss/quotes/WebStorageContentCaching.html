            ========= WebStorage-driven Content Caching ========= </a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>"While this API can be used for client-side state management, it is also often used for caching[17] (See Section IV for more details). Especially, <strong>in mobile environments where bandwidth and latency matters</strong> Web-Storage-based caching can be a powerful technique <strong>to decrease loading times</strong> by saving and reusing frequently required scripts or style declarations on the mobile device[17]."</li>
            <li>"However, caching such content in a storage that is <strong>accessible via scripting</strong> is a dangerous practice as it <strong>creates new attack vectors</strong> for adversaries. The cause of the problem is the fact that at one point in time, <strong>code written to the storage has to be executed again</strong>. Hence, if an attacker is able to <strong>exchange the cached code with his payload</strong>, the application automatically <strong>runs the malicious content</strong>". Well-known cross-site scripting defense techniques such as <strong>input validation or output encoding are not applicable in this scenario</strong></li>
            <li>"Modern browsers allow Web applications to provide offline capabilities. For this, the application can explicitly specify which of its Web resources should be kept in the browser’s application cache [2]. This is done using a dedicated manifest file that lists the URLs of to be stored resources. In situations, in which the Web browser is disconnected form the network, these files, which were stored earlier, are loaded and rendered from the appcache"</li>             
            <li>"some applications use Web storage for caching Web page components, such as HTML fragments, CSS styles, or Javascripts, which are meant to be included verbatim into the Web page after retrieval from storage"</li>
            <li>"By inserting JavaScript code into one of the site’s code fragments which are kept in Web storage, the attacker can ensure, that his malicious payload is executed every time the victim accesses the Web application with his browser, potentially for an unlimited amount time"</li>
