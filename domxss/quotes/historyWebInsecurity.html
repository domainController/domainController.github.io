        <ol>
             <li>"Along with the dawn of JavaScript-driven applications in the early years of the millennium, the likelihood of client-side injection vulnerabilities has risen"</li>
             <li>"To nevertheless allow applications to communicate across these boundaries, different technologies can be used. One technique to do so is called JSONP,    short for JSON with padding."</li>
             <li>"CORS is a policy deployed by the server and is meant to control data access when a request is conducted with the XMLHttpRequest API [41]."</li>
             <li>"He called it DOM-based since he argued that it was caused by using attacker-provided data in interactions with the DocumentObject Model (DOM). Nowadays, this does not hold true anymore considering that the eval construct allows for JavaScript execution without the use of any DOM functionality."</li>
             <li>"We therefore analyzed our data set in two dimensions: <strong>handling of received postMessages without performing origin checks</strong> and <strong>calls to the postMessage API with a wildcard origin</strong>."</li>
             <li>"Although all markup and programming languages used in the Web are well-specified, <strong>Web application developers often make more or less subtle mistakes</strong> when building their sites. <strong>To still allow users of these sites an unhindered view on the pages</strong>, modern browsers are very error-tolerant, i.e., they compensate for a number of mistakes which can be introduced by developers. <strong>One of the mechanisms used to achieve this tolerance is content sniffing</strong>, a technique used by browsers to guess the type of content being shown, to allow for proper rendering. The HTTP/1.1 standard specifically states that such sniffing should only happen when no <strong>Content-Type header</strong> is sent from the server [5]."</li>
             <li>"To prevent such attacks, Internet Explorer first implemented the <strong>X-Content-Type-Options header</strong> in 2008 [15]."</li>
             <li>"While the unsolicited framing itself was already discussed before the devastating demonstration by Grossman, the clear attack potential as shown by their attack in 2008 motivated browser vendors to develop and deploy a protective measure, dubbed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNlcoYLIGFk&t=772s">X-Frame-Options</a> header (for short also XFO). Even though <strong>the X in the name denotes the fact that this was not a standardized header</strong>, it as introduced within a few months after the presented attack by Internet Explorer and Firefox, while Chrome followed a year later"</li>
             <li>"In its foundation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNlcoYLIGFk&t=972s">CSP</a> is a technique that aims to specifically whitelist sources of code with the goal of stoppingany attacker-provided code from being executed"</li>
             <li>"Also, by default, CSP disallows the use of inline script elements and the eval construct."</li>
             <li>"As previous work has shown, setting up CSP for legacy applications is very challenging. Our data indicates that even by 2016, less than 10% of the sites we considered deployed any CSP at all. Hence, although CSP mitigates the effect of XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript-enabled Web applications, its adoption still lags far behind other security measures."</li>
             <li>To ensure that neither an active attacker can strip SSL nor an unknowing developer can accidentally build an insecure application, browsers implement HTTP Strict Transport Security, or HSTS for short [8]. With this HTTP header, browsers can be instructed to only <strong>connect to a domain via HTTPS regardless of the URL</strong> and to only do so <strong>using a validated certificate</strong>.</li>
             <li>"As an example, while jQuery 1.0 only contained 768 statements, the most recent version 1.12 (in the 1.* branch) already consists of 3,541 statements. Moreover, <strong>sites rarely update their third-party components</strong>."</li>
             <li>"Many new technologies introduced in browsers come with security mechanisms, such as the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> properties provided by the postMessage API. However, <strong>oftentimes these features are optional</strong> — a developer may, e.g., choose not to check the origin of an incoming postMessage"</li>
             <li>While CSP allows very fine-grained control over resources that can be accessed and — more importantly — script code which can be executed, <strong>setting up a working CSP policy is often tough</strong>. Apart from this hurdle, significant changes on the application itself are required. This high effort must be considered a big roadblock for CSP’s success. In contrast, <strong>headers like HSTS or XSO, which are easy to deploy and address a single issue</strong>, are adopted more swiftly in a shorter timeframe. Thus, we argue that for future techniques ease of use should be a primary design concern. Make Security</li>
