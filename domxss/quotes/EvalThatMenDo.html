            <li>"One of the most dynamic features of JavaScript is the eval construct, which parses a string argument as source code and immediately executes it.While there are other means of turning text into code, including the Function constructor, setInterval, setTimeout, and indirect means such as adding script> nodes to the DOM with document.write, this paper focuses on eval as a representative of this class of techniques for dynamically loading program source at runtime"</li>
            <li>"Eval can be traced back to the first days of Lisp [16]
where eval provided the first implementation of the language that, until then, was translated
by hand to machine code. It has since been included in many programming languages,
though often under other names or wrapped inside a structured interface."</li>
            <li>"In JavaScript, eval is a function defined in the global object. When
invoked with a single string argument, it parses and executes the argument. It returns
the result of the last evaluated expression, or propagates any thrown exception. eval can
be invoked in two ways: If it is called directly, the evalâ€™d code has access to all variables
lexically in scope"</li>
