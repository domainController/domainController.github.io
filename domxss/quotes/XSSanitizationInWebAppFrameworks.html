        ========= A Systematic Analysis of XSS Sanitization in Web Application Frameworks ========= </a></h2>

            <li>"However, sanitization or filtering, the practice of encoding or eliminating dangerous constructs in untrusted data, remains the industrystandard defense strategy [45]"</li>
            <li>"XSS sanitization is deviously complex; it involves understanding <strong>how the web browser parses and interprets web content</strong> in non-trivial detail."</li>
            <li>"<strong>Context Expressiveness</strong>. Untrusted data needs to be sanitized differently based on its context in the HTML document. For example, the sanitization requirements of a URI attribute are different from those of an HTML tag."</li>
            <li>"Consider a blogging web application <strong>that emits untrusted content, such as anonymous comments</strong>, on the web page If the developer is not careful, an attacker can input text such as \<script\>...\<script\>, which may be output verbatim in the server’s output HTML page. When a user visits this blog page, her web browser will execute the attacker controlled text as script code.XSS sanitization requires removal of such dangerous tags from the untrusted data"</li>
            <li>"We present a comprehensive model of the <strong>web browser’s parsing behavior</strong>."</li>
            <li>"Abstractly, the browser can be viewed as a collection of HTML-related sub-grammars and a collection of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducteur_fini">transducers</a>. Sub-grammars correspond to parsers for languages such as URI schemes, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript"</li>
            <li>"<strong>Transducers transform or change the representation of the text, such as in HTML-entity encoding/decoding, URI-encoding, JavaScript Unicode encoding</strong> and so on"</li>
            <li>"Consider an embedding of an untrusted string inside a script block, such as <script> var x = ‘ UNTRUSTED DATA’...</script>. In this example, when the underlined data is read by the browser, it is simultaneously placed in two contexts. <strong>It is placed in a JavaScript string literal context by the JavaScript parser</strong> (edge 2) due to the single quotes. But, before that, it is inside a <strong>the HTML parser</strong>. Two distinct attack vectors can be used here: the attacker could use a single quote to break out of the JavaScript string context, or inject </script> to break out of the script tag. In fact, sanitizers commonly fail to account for the latter because they do not recognize the presence of nested contexts."</li>
