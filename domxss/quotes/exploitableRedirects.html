        <ol>             
            <li>"From a security viewpoint, the most interesting category of redirects are the ones that are open. Links containing redirects often use parameters to control the destination of the redirect. If the Web server does not check the parameters appropriately before taking action, one can manipulate the destination"
            </li>

            <li>"A variety of mechanisms can be used to implement redirects. The most popular technique, also highly recommended by theWorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C), is the HTTP redirect."
            </li>

            <li>"A less commonly used approach exploits the HTML refresh to redirect users"</li>


            <li>"Another less common approach uses client-side scripting, such as JavaScript. When a user clicks on a redirect that uses this technique, the Web server sends a new Web page containing JavaScript which specifies the destination of the redirect. This technique also causes an additional HTML page to be fetched. Additionally, the redirect may not happen if the client browser does not support JavaScript or has it disabled."
            </li>

            <li>"Regardless of the mechanism used to implement them, a redirect may be either static or dynamic"
            </li>

            <li>"Links containing static redirects always lead to the same destination. Since these links cannot be manipulated, they are not interesting from the perspective of potential abuse; therefore, we do not consider them in this paper."
            </li>

            <li>"The links containing dynamic redirects often embed the destination of the redirect in an optional query string contained in the URL itself. When a user clicks on the link, the browser sends the query string with the request. The Web server reads the parameters contained in the query string to decide the destination of the redirect. Dynamic redirects offer greater flexibility and convenience for the Web site operator, but can be abused if not properly secured"</li>

            <li>"We consider the link to contain a potential redirect if a query string is found containing a URL pattern."</li>

            <li>"A redirect is open if the destination contained in its query string can be altered and the Web server processing the redirect sends the client to the new location without validation."</li>

            <li>"If a redirect employs weak protections, it may be possible to pry it open"</li>

            <li>"Redirects which have query strings with only one parameter, the URL of the destination, clearly do not have other query string parameters securing the redirect"</li>

            <li>"Redirects whose query strings have at least one parameter other than the destination required some thought. If altering the destination and leaving the remaining parameters unchanged failed to open the redirect, the redirect is secured internally or there is at least one parameter the server is testing before redirecting"</li>
