            <li>"They play the role of an in-browser web application proxy able to intercept HTTP requests and immediately serve HTTP responses present on a cache, or even generate responses on the fly, fetch them from a remote server, cache a copy and return the response to the web application."
            </li>             
            <li>" In the recent years, the Web has witnessed the introduction of a profusion of security policies, such as Content-Security-Policy, Feature-Policy, Referrer-Policy, etc. aimed at mitigating the impact of widespread web attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, Clickjacking, etc. Worryingly, when a content is cached, so are its security policies meant to protect it.

            <li>"The functionality of the service worker itself, as registered in Listing 1, is defined within the file sw.js, hosted by the application registrating the service worker."
            </li>             
            <li>"Coupled with the Cache API, a service worker can be used to provide an offline or better userexperience for web applications"
            </li>  
            <li>"These policies are often shipped as headers of responses to navigation HTTP requests (requests to load HTML documents), where they govern and protect content on entire web pages. When these documents are cached by service workers, so are their security policies, which an attacker can manipulate in order to revert their effects and perform malicious actions,"
