            <li>"They play the role of an in-browser web application proxy able to intercept HTTP requests and immediately serve HTTP responses present on a cache, or even generate responses on the fly, fetch them from a remote server, cache a copy and return the response to the web application."
            </li>
            <li>"In this work, we focus on the Cache API and its current design. Indeed, the cache where service workers store HTTP requests and responses is bound to the entire <a href="../definition.html#origin">origin</a> of the application managed by the service worker."
            </li> 
            <li>"We found real world and highly ranked web applications <u></u>>that are caching security policies</u> that can be bypassed in case of an attack."
            </li>          
            <li>" In the recent years, the Web has witnessed the introduction of a profusion of security policies, such as Content-Security-Policy, Feature-Policy, Referrer-Policy, etc. aimed at mitigating the impact of widespread web attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting, Clickjacking, etc. Worryingly, when a content is cached, <strong>so are its security policies</strong> meant to protect it. "
            </li>
            <li>we argue that service workers’ <strong>cache should be made inaccessible to scripts</strong></li>

            <li>"a new class of threats, or more precisely, they exacerbate the power of the standard web attacker"
            </li>             
            <li>"The functionality of the service worker itself, as registered in Listing 1, is defined within the file sw.js, hosted by the application registrating the service worker."
            </li>
            <li>"To be accessible, responses must either be from the <a href="../definition.html#SOPDefinition">same-origin</a> as the service worker, or if they are cross-origins, they must be allowed by <a href="../definition.html#CORSDefinition">CORS</a>."
            </li> 
            <li>"If <strong>the Cache API is dedicated to storing HTTP requests and responses</strong>, IndexedDB is a more general-purpose storage where different contexts can store and share data"
            </li>            
            <li>"Coupled with the Cache API, a service worker can be used to provide an offline or better userexperience for web applications"
            </li>  
            <li>"These policies are often shipped as headers of responses to navigation HTTP requests (requests to load HTML documents), where they govern and protect content on entire web pages. When these documents are cached by service workers, so are their security policies, which an attacker can manipulate in order to revert their effects and perform malicious actions,"

            </li>
            <li>"The attacks that we have discussed in this work have all to do with the fact that the service worker cache is bound to the entire origin, and thus can be accessed by potentially malicious scripts running in same-origin web pages."
            </li>
            <li>"To mitigate this issue, we think that browser vendors should make the cache of service workers inaccessible to other same-origin browsing contexts"</li>
