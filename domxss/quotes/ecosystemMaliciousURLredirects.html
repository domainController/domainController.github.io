            <li>The iframe and meta tag insertions were only 1.0% and less than 0.1% respectively. In contrast, the script tag insertion became a major injection method over time, which accounted for 70.8% of all observed file modifications. In this case, almost all script tag insertions were script tags <strong>without src attribution</strong>. This means that obfuscated JavaScript is inside script tags and dynamically outputs iframe tags or executes location redirects after de-obfuscating itself.

            <li>Even if an attacker compromises websites and injects redirect code, a redirect destination is not necessarily related to malware infection but rather web advertising and tracking
            </li>

            <li>The aim of web advertising and tracking is to induce <strong>click-fraud monetization</strong> such as fraudulently utilizing <strong>pay-per-click advertising</strong> (PPC); therefore, this seems to be another aim of malicious URL redirection.
            </li>

            <li>In contrast, injecting redirect code into compromised websites is an alternative to recruit general public web users for PPC. The more popular the website an attacker compromises, the more web users an attacker can simultaneously recruit withoutmuch effort. Therefore, injecting redirect code is more cost effective and scalable than recruiting click bots.
            </li>

            <li>While the domains of doubleclick, google-analytics, and googlesyndication provide popular web advertising and tracking services, they are also widely used by redirect codes injected into compromised websites.
            </li>

            <li>Our analysis revealed that attackers use the following techniques: domain-flux by web-based DGAs, IP-flux by fast-flux service networks (FFSNs), redirection controlling by traffic distribution networks (TDSs), and target profiling by tracking services</li>
