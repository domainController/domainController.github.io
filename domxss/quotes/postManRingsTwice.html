            <li>"Popular sites often include  <strong>third-party content</strong>: advertisements, buttons for social recommendations, scripts for performance measurement and visitor tracking, etc."</li>
            <li>"while the frame from a <a href="https://zozimus.com/blog/how-to-track-a-button-click-event-in-google-analytics-using-google-tag-manager/">"business optimization”</a> service may <strong>track users’ movements and clicks</strong> on the page that includes this frame."</li>
            <li>"Cross-origin messages sent via postMessage are “authenticated” in the sense that Web browsers correctly set their origin attribute to the sender’s origin, but <strong>the recipient must check this attribute and verify that the message comes from the expected sender</strong>. These checks are non-trivial and cross-document messaging is considered the top HTML5 security threat [23]."</li>
             <li>"If the thirdparty frame does not contain any security-critical functionality, there is no immediate threat. Unfortunately, our study shows that <strong>some popular third-party frames contain unprotected operations such as writing to local storage or cookies</strong> which <strong>can be triggered by received messages</strong>."</li>
             <li>"The postMessage mechanism in HTML5 relaxes the same origin policy <strong>by allowing a script to send a string</strong> to any window in the same or different origin."</li>
