            <li>"CSPs can be specified inside the Content-Security- Policy header or by including them in <meta> tags inside an HTML head section."</li>
            <li>"First, even though CSP offers the report-only mode to enable developers to experiment with policies before deployment, this mode is not nearly as popular as the enforcement mode. This means that most developers are rolling out policies without having a chance to test them on their user base. We suspect that this is one of the main reasons why CSPs in the wild are so relaxed since they have not been appropriately evaluated and the developers eventually opted for utility over security"</li>
            <li>"Unfortunately, CSP — especially for its original use case of script content restriction — is way more complicated than other security mechanisms and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the appropriate sources are whitelisted so that the site remains operational and secure."
