            <li>"The Propagation component represents <strong>the statements</strong> which propagate tainted values from the source to the sink without modifying them. This component mainly considers the <u>language features and information flows</u> that affect the propagated tainted values, including:"</li>
            <li>"Each one of them has its vulnerable and safe form"</li>
            <li>"There are four possible outcomes for each test case. A Web page might be detected as vulnerable to DOM-based XSS when it is truly vulnerable (true positive, TP); it might be detected as vulnerable when it is actually safe (false positive, FP); it might be detected as safe and it is truly safe (true negative, TN); or it might be detected as safe when it is actually safe (false negative, FN)."</li>
            <li>"But <strong>some advanced or indirect sources are missed by most tools</strong>, such as <u>client-side storage and sources from message passing mechanism</u>, producing false negatives."</li>
            <li>"All tools are not able to distinguish builtin sanitization functions and customized sanitization functions"</li>
            <li>"Symbolic execution and SMT (satisfiability modulo theories) solver [33] might be candidate techniques for improving existing tools in this direction."</li>
            <li>"Just like the sources, <u>a lot of advanced or indirect sinks are not detected by most tools</u>. The reason might be these sources and sinks are not very common and <strong>not easy to exploit</strong>, thus these tools choose <strong>efficiency at the cost of coverage</strong>"</li>
