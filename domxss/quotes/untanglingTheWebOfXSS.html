                <li id="analysisofvulnjs">"They find that <strong>the most common usage for <a href="sinksources.html#eval">eval</a> is the parsing of JSON</strong>, although the JSON.parse method provides an equivalent, yet secure functionality."</li>
            </ol>
            <li>"In addition to the Same-Origin Policy for JavaScript interaction and DOM access between documents, other types of Same-Origin Policies exist for XmlHttpRequests (van Kesteren et al., 2014) or Flash (Zalewski, 2009b). <strong>For XmlHttpRequests, the policy can be relaxed using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong> (van Kesteren, 2014) <strong>to allow cross-domain communication</strong>"</li>
            <li>"Essentially, <strong>this type of attack constitutes a bypass of the Same-Origin Policy</strong> since the code injected by the attacker is used to gain access to resources which would normally not be accessible to it."</li>
            <li>"<strong>Non-persistent Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting</strong> As the name of this type of Cross-Site Scripting, which is also often referred to as Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, correctly suggest, this variant does not persistently store the attackerâ€™s XSS payload on the server". In contrast, vulnerabilities of this kind are caused by Web pages which <strong>consume user-provided input (such as a GET parameter) and subsequently reflect or echo it back to the user</strong>.</li>
            <li>"The term taint tracking refers to a technique which is used to track the flow of data throughout the execution of a program (Schwartz et al., 2010). The process can conceptually be split up into <strong>three stages: taint introduction, taint propagation and taint checking</strong>."</li>
            <li>"They did, however, find evidence to suggest that more complex pages (such as news sites) are prone to contain more errors, i.e., determining that code complexity is correlated to the number of discovered flaws."</li>
            <li>"In addition to the number of operations that are passed when a flow of data occurs, the number of functions which are traversed is an indicator for the complexity of a flow or a vulnerability. Naturally, <strong>the analyst has to understand and audit each of those functions to ensure that a flow of usercontrolled data is not exploitable</strong>"</li>
            <li>"Figure 5.6 shows this, highlighting also that more than <strong>90% of the vulnerabilities were not spread across more than two contexts</strong>"</li>
