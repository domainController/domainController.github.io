            <li>To assist developers in securing their applications, the Web platform has evolved to support more and more server-sent, yet <strong>client-enforced security mechanisms</strong>"</li>
            <li>"possible. Examples of popular <strong>client-side security mechanisms</strong> include Content Security Policy (CSP) [25], cookie security attributes [3], and HSTS [11]."</li>
            <li>"In this paper, we are concerned about inconsistencies in framing control, a cornerstone of Web application security, which pioneered the adoption of client-side security mechanisms."</li>
            <li>"Framing control constrains the inclusion of Web content inside iframes (sub-documents) opened by malicious pages and it is particularly useful to prevent click-jacking attacks"</li>
            <li>"In 2009, Internet Explorer introduced the X-Frame-Options header (XFO) as a simple, browser-based mechanism to control framing without relying on JavaScript"</li>
            <li>"In 2014, the second iteration of the CSP specification introduced the frame-ancestors directive to control framing, with the goal of obsoleting XFO and to offer a comprehensive, uniform protection mechanism for all CSP-compliant browsers"</li>
            <li>"Most browsers provide two different defenses in the form of XFO and CSP, possibly with different implementations, and developers may choose to use any of these two mechanisms, or a combination thereof, to protect their Web applications"</li>
            <li>"Importantly, although an XFO specification exists in the form of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034">RFC 7034</a>, that specification was written after various browsers had implemented XFO and notes that “not all browsers implement X-Frame-Options in exactly the same way, which can lead to unintended results”."</li>
            <li>"Overall, we find that XFO is indeed <strong>inconsistently implemented across browsers</strong>."</li>
            <li>"While initially meant as a means of mitigating injection attacks, CSP nowadays offers support for framing control and TLS enforcement as well."</li>
            <li>"the Referer header of incoming HTTP requests. This header is sent by browsers and indicates the document which initiated the loading of a specific resource (in this case, an iframe)."</li>
